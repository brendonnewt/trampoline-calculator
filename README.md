Hi! I made this trampoline difficulty calculator as a way to learn python. It ended up becoming a full Flask project with html, css, and javascript because I decided I wanted to work towards making it a web app. For now, to run it you just need to download everything in the repository and run calculator-app.py through the python3 interpreter.

For example, $python3 calculator-app.py

Thank you for checking it out!
